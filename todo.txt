Map:
    On all cases, Dairy farms can you add an outline to those states?
        This means that the overlay of at least the dairy farm'd states should be full opacity so the outline applies
        But, when hovering over a specific county, we need the overlay at 0 opacity EXCEPT for the county being hovered over

on bottom right can you add two buttons so it is clear there is a zoom function?
